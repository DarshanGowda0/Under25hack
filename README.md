###How it works ??


    The song is recorded with the karaoke in the background,
    the record song is then mixed with other users voice of the same song from the database and the song is posted on a         social timeline in the app

for example :
    If user1, user2, user3, user4, user5  has sung "We will rock you" song  and the present user(lets assume Darshan) then the song from Darshan's voice is clipped to 10 seconds and the 20-30 s of the song is clipped from user1 & 30-40 s of the song is clipped from user2 and so on,  finally all the clips are joined and made into a compilation and the compiled song is
overlaid on the karoake of the original song posted on the timeline.
